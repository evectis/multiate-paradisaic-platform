A “bundling” together of existing Open Source products to create a “platform” that provides the best Web 2.0/Social-network features. What is the difference? Do it with security as a major core component….i.e. support for secure rich media (digital images, videos, audio, etc) information sharing implemented on these 10 core concepts:

Propagate - Become distributed or widespread. Cause to become widely known.
Affiliate - Keep company with; hang out with.
Relate - Have or establish a relationship to.
Associate - Make a logical or causal connection.
Duplicate - Increase twofold.
Integrate - Make into a whole or make part of a whole.
Syndicate - Organize into or form a syndicate.
Aggregate - Gather in a mass, sum, or whole.
Interoperate - Able to exchange and use information.
Communicate - Transmit information.

Like IBM's Project Blue Spruce, the software supports an environment for pulling together data, tools and widgets from around the Web to assemble the elements needed for secure business communications.

“Communication is the key”
