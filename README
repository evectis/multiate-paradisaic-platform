A bundling together of existing Open Source products and open standards to create a “platform” that provides the best Web 3.0/Social-networking features. What is the difference? Do it with security as a major core component….i.e. support for secure rich media (digital images, videos, audio, etc) information sharing implemented to suuport these 10 information usage core concepts:

Propagate - Become distributed or widespread, cause to become widely known.
Authenticate - Confirm positive identity.
Relate - Have or establish a relationship to.
Associate - Make a logical or causal connection.
Duplicate - Increase twofold.
Investigate - Seeking knowledge or the truth about something.
Syndicate - Organize into or form a syndicate.
Aggregate - Gather in a mass, sum, or whole.
Integrate - Make into a whole or make part of a whole.
Curate, Collaborate, Communicate - Organize, oversee, work together and transmit information.

Built upon enhanced semantic web concepts, this platform supports an environment for pulling together data, tools and widgets from around the Web to assemble the elements needed for secure business communications.

“In the end....Communication is the key”…
